# FakeNews_Distinguishing_MachineLearning
Distinguishing between fake and real news by using text mining algorithm

I used text mining algorithm to distinguish fake news by counting word frequency.
Preporcessing: 
  1) removing pronouns
  2) removing word "reuters"
  3) lemmatizing (stopwords)
  4) word frequency

Machine learning algorithms
  1) Logistic Regression
  2) Naive Bayes
  3) Random Forest
  4) SVM

Data visualization
  1) Histogram
  2) Word Cloud
